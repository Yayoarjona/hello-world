Hi!.

I'm Jairo.

Usually my work is in mathematics (theory of computation and combinatorics; algebraic combinatorics [2-structures], graphs and combinatorics on words. And applications of these things in mathematical models into phylogenetics). Now I want to start working on programming and implementation of algorithms.
